        <div class="history-text">
          <p>Union Beach, a vibrant coastal community in Monmouth County, New Jersey, has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. The borough was officially formed on March 16, 1925, when it separated from portions of Raritan Township, becoming an independent municipality with its own identity and governance.</p>

          <p>The area's development was closely tied to the Jersey Shore's growing popularity as a summer destination. Early settlers were drawn to the waterfront location along Raritan Bay, and the community quickly grew from a seasonal retreat into a year-round residential area. The name "Union Beach" reflects the coming together of different communities and the unity of residents who worked to establish this distinctive shore town.</p>

          <p>Throughout the decades, Union Beach has faced challenges with resilience, particularly during natural disasters and economic changes. The community's strong spirit and dedication to preserving its heritage have been constants through periods of growth and transformation. Today, Union Beach continues to honor its past while looking toward the future, maintaining its close-knit community character and connection to the waterfront that first drew settlers to this special place.</p>

        <div class="history-text">
          <p>The Union Beach Memorial Library holds a special place in the heart of our community, serving not only as a center for learning and culture but also as a lasting tribute to local heroes. In 1946, the library was officially renamed the Union Beach Memorial Library in memory of 12 brave local men who made the ultimate sacrifice during World War II.</p>

          <p>These 12 servicemen, who gave their lives in service to their country during one of history's most significant conflicts, came from the families and neighborhoods of Union Beach. Their courage and dedication exemplified the very best of the American spirit, and the community chose to honor their memory by dedicating the library to their legacy. This memorial designation ensures that their sacrifice will never be forgotten and that future generations will remember the price of freedom.</p>

          <p>Over the decades, the library has evolved from a small local collection into a vital community resource. As a proud member of the Monmouth County Library System, Union Beach Memorial Library provides residents with access to an extensive collection of materials, digital resources, and programs that serve all ages. The library continues to fulfill its dual mission: providing exceptional library services while serving as a permanent memorial to those who served.</p>

          <p>The connection to the Monmouth County library system has greatly expanded the resources available to Union Beach residents, offering access to a vast network of books, digital materials, interlibrary loan services, and shared programming. This partnership ensures that our small community library can provide world-class services while maintaining its intimate, local character and its sacred mission of remembrance.</p>
